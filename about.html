        Safety First Wales is a coalition of sex workers, health professionals, academics, anti-poverty,
        anti-violence, trans rights campaigners and church representatives that recently formed with the aim of
        bringing about the decriminalisation of sex work and prioritisation of sex workersâ€™ safety, health, and
        well-being in Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our network aims to raise awareness and understanding of the struggles sex workers face. We want to ensure
        that it is no longer possible for sex workers voices and accounts of their experiences to be ignored and
        overlooked in Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
        Members of our network have witnessed, and in many cases experienced the ways in which sex work and the
        safety of sex workers is undermined by a variety of factors that are often overlooked by those with the
        power to instigate lasting change. By documenting and disseminating these experiences, we seek to draw
        attention to the problems of initiatives that focus on policing and law enforcement as a means of reducing
        sex work, rather than the provision of benefits, housing and other resources for women to enable and empower
        them to leave and refuse prostitution.
